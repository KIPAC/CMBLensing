Kavli CMB Lensing workshop website, 2017

Gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) will be one of the primary sources of new information about the universe from current and future surveys.  While lensing measurement techniques are mature enough to have demonstrated success, the precision required from future measurements will be extremely challenging.  This workshop aims to bring together current and aspiring lensing experts from around the world in an interactive workshop to discuss the current state of the field and plan for the challenges of the future.

Workshop goals:
 * Identify and discuss challenges in current and future CMB lensing measurements.
 * Provide a space for lensing experts from different groups to dive deep into the details of lensing analysis challenges.
 * Summarize current measurements of CMB lensing with a focus on the current problems and future challenges.  We hope this will include lensing reconstruction, lensing power spectrum, delensing (both T, E, and B), cross-correlations and cluster lensing mass measurements.
 * Summarize current theoretical work on lensing with a focus on future challenges.
 * Identify and plan for challenges of future CMB lensing measurements.
